            <h2>What is Energy Efficiency?</h2>
            <p style="margin: 20px; font-size: 20px;">Simply put, energy efficiency means using less energy to get the same job done – and in the process, cutting energy bills and reducing pollution. Many products, homes, and buildings use more energy than they actually need, through inefficiencies and energy waste. Energy efficiency is one of the easiest ways to eliminate energy waste and lower energy costs. It is also one of the most cost-effective ways to combat climate change, clean the air we breathe, help families meet their budgets, and help businesses improve their bottom lines. Millions of American consumers and businesses choose or invest in energy-efficient products.</p>
            <h3 style="margin: 20px; font-size: 22px;">Examples of energy efficiency</h3>
            <p style="margin: 30px; font-size: 18px;">Anywhere that energy is used, there is an opportunity to improve efficiency. Some products, like energy-efficient light bulbs, simply use less energy to produce the same amount of light. Other products don’t use energy directly, but they improve the overall efficiency and comfort of a house or a building (such as thermal insulation or windows).</p>
            <ul style="margin: 30px; font-size: 18px;">
                <li>Light bulbs: An LED light bulb that has earned the ENERGY STAR label uses 70-90% less energy than an incandescent light bulb, while providing the same illumination.</li>
                <li>Windows: Energy-efficient windows are made with materials that reduce heat exchange and air leaks, which means you don’t need as much energy to heat or cool a space.</li>
                <li>Insulation: Adding more insulation to an attic keeps the warm air inside from escaping in the winter. In the summer, it keeps hot air out. With good insulation, you won’t need to use as much energy to keep your house warm in the winter or cool in the summer.</li>
                <li>Smart thermostats: Smart thermostats are Wi-Fi enabled devices that control heating and cooling in your home by learning your temperature preferences and schedule to automatically adjust to energy-saving temperatures when you are asleep or away. They can help you lower your energy bills by not spending money to heat or cool an empty house.</li>

            <h1>Expanding India’s energy efficiency sector</h1>
            <p style="margin: 20px;    font-size: 18px;">Increased greenhouse gas emissions as a result of India’s increased energy consumption and the country’s future dependence on fossil fuels to serve its energy security have raised serious environmental concerns. As an emerging economy, India has a huge opportunity to meet its development goals in minimal energy consumption. Energy efficiency, termed as ‘the first fuel’ by the International Energy Agency (IEA), will play a pivotal role in determining an optimal energy portfolio for India.</p>
            <p style="margin: 20px;    font-size: 18px;">The deployment of clean energy systems is gaining momentum through policy interventions in India and across the globe. Although, one of the most inexpensive achievable option available is adopting an energy efficient lifestyle. Energy efficiency is increasingly becoming a key pillar of energy transformation policies in the world. Implementing robust energy efficiency interventions lead to curbed air pollution, decarbonisation, improved energy access, better resource use and enhanced energy security. The transition to clean energy will be faster and cheaper if energy efficiency measures are undertaken. <a href="https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/expanding-indias-energy-efficiency-sector/">Read More....</a> </p>

            <h1>Energy Efficiency in India</h1>
            <p style="margin: 20px;font-size: 18px;">The primary energy demand in India has grown from about 450 million tons of oil equivalent (toe) in 2000 to about 770 million toe in 2012. This is expected to increase to about 1250 (estimated by International Energy Agency) to 1500 (estimated in the Integrated Energy Policy Report) million toe in 2030. This increase is driven by a number of factors, the most important of which are increasing incomes and economic growth which lead to greater demand for energy services such as lighting, cooking, space cooling, mobility, industrial production, office automation, etc. This growth is also reflective of the current very low level of energy supply in India: the average annual energy supply in India in 2011 was only 0.6 toe per capita; whereas the global average was 1.88 toe per capita. It may also be noted that no country in the world has been able to achieve a Human Development Index of 0.9 or more without an annual energy supply of at least 4 toe per capita. Consequently, there is a large latent demand for energy services that needs to be fulfilled in order for people to have reasonable incomes and a decent quality of life.</p>
            <p style="margin: 20px;font-size: 18px;">Government of India has undertaken a two pronged approach to cater to the energy demand of its citizens while ensuring minimum growth in CO2 emissions, so that the global emissions do not lead to an irreversible damage to the earth system. On one hand, in the generation side, the Government is promoting greater use of renewable in the energy mix mainly through solar and wind and at the same time shifting towards supercritical technologies for coal based power plants. On the other side, efforts are being made to efficiently use the energy in the demand side through various innovative policy measures under the overall ambit of Energy Conservation Act 2001. <a href="https://powermin.gov.in/en/content/energy-efficiency">Read More....</a> </p>
